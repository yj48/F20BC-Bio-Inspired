To Run Code:
  Run exampleexperiment.m in matlab
  Running will bring up a graph of fitness over iterations
  The "best" optimisation solution is set to the default
  
To Display Iteration by Iteration Expected vs Generated Graph:
  In exampleexperiment.m comment lines 62-71 as indicated
  In MYOPTIMIZER.m uncomment lines 130 and 131
  
Program Information:
  My code contained within MYOPTIMIZER.m (calls functions to do neural network/genetic algorithm functions)
  exampleexperiment.m COCO code which runs MYOPTIMIZER.m
